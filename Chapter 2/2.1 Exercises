In the following, let $g$ and $h$ be elements of group $G$ if unspecified, and let $e$ be the identity.
\epigraph{\textbb{Definition.} A group is a groupoid with a single object}{Joke}
\begin{problem}
    Write a careful proof that every group is the group of isomorphisms of a groupoid. In particular, every group is the group of automorphisms of some object in some category.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Take the categary $\mathfrak{C}$ with a single object $O$ and $\text{Hom}(O,O)=G$ with composition in $\text{Hom}(O,O)$ given by the operation in $G$. Check everything.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Consider the sets of numbers listed in \S1.1, and decide which are made into groups by conventional operations such as addition and multiplication.
    If the answer is no, can we modify the group by a bit (such as removing $0$) to make it under a group for that operation?
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Just for completeness, the sets are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \ii \varnothing
        \ii \NN
        \ii \ZZ
        \ii \QQ
        \ii \RR
        \ii \CC
    \end{enumerate}
    Corrosponding groups:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \ii \varnothing is not a group because groups need an identity.
        \ii \NN is not a group under addition or multiplication becuse there is no inverses
        \ii \ZZ is a group under addition, however it is not a group under multiplication as there is no identity.
        \ii \QQ is a group under addition. Remove $0$ to get a group under multiplication.
        \ii Same as \QQ.
        \ii Same as \QQ, \RR.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Prove that $(gh)\inv=h\inv g\inv$.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Because $(gh)\inv\cdot h\inv g\inv=e$.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Suppose $g^2=e$ for all $g$. Show that $G$ is abelian.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    $gh=g\inv h\inv=(hg)\inv=hg$.
\end{soln}
